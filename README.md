# Overview:

In this project, you are required to implement a simulation of a port management system. The main objective is to analyze the requests provided in input and carry out the necessary actions.

There are ports, and ships are sailing between them. Ships are carrying the following types of containers: basic, heavy, refrigerated, liquid, and each of them should be handled differently. Containers in a port can be loaded to ships, and, conversely, they can be unloaded from a ship to port. Ships need a certain amount of fuel to sail from one port to another.

Here are list of operations that needs to be performed. 
A port have unique Id, geolocation, country and list of ships and containers. 
A ship can dock and undock from a port and have unique Id, fuel, and containers in it. You and load and unload containers from a ship. Ship have weight and size (number of containers) limit. Each port have docking cost, cost per minute and cost of weight loading/unloading from the ship. A shipped is billed when it departs the port. 
All containers should have their Id, departure port, destination port, type, capacity, weight.
You can load <= 3000 kg on Basic Container and <= 5000 on heavy they are priced $2 per kg. refrigerated and liquid containers both have 2500 kg limit and cost is 3.5 per kg. 


## Task 1:
Create a desing document of all classes required for this project. Create relationship of objects interacting with eachother to perform certain tasks. 

#### Solution: 
- 


## Task 2:
Perform following operations using console application. 

    1. Dock a ship to port
    2. List ship statistics by showing capacity, size, number of container and their types. 
    3. Bill a ship
    4. Unlock a container from ship
    5. Load a container from ship
    6. Add fuel to ship
    7. Depart a ship to another port.
